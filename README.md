Here's a structured README template for your "Computer-vision-and-back-end" repository focused on the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS):

# Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)

## Overview

The **Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)** is designed to enhance vehicle safety and improve the driving experience through advanced computer vision techniques. This system utilizes computer vision to detect lane departures, pedestrians, and obstacles on the road. Additionally, it features a back-end system for data logging, real-time alerts, and driving suggestions.

## Features

- **Lane Departure Detection**: Monitors vehicle position and alerts the driver when leaving the designated lane.
- **Pedestrian Detection**: Identifies pedestrians in the vehicle's path to prevent potential accidents.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Detects obstacles on the road and provides real-time alerts to the driver.
- **Data Logging**: Collects and stores vehicle data for analysis and review.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Notifies the driver of critical situations through alerts and warnings.
- **Driving Suggestions**: Offers driving tips and suggestions based on real-time data analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, or similar libraries for image processing and object detection.
- **Back-End**: Flask, Django, or Node.js for handling requests, data logging, and alerts.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite for storing vehicle data and logs.
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket or similar protocols for real-time alerts and notifications.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Computer-vision-and-back-end.git
   cd Computer-vision-and-back-end
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   For Python-based back-end:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For Node.js-based back-end:
