EfficientNet
Focuses on balancing depth, width, and resolution of the network to achieve high performance with lower computational cost.

Ideal for applications requiring efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

2. Swin Transformer
A cutting-edge vision transformer model that uses shifted windows for self-attention.

Great for tasks involving global context understanding, like object recognition or image segmentation.

3. DINO (Self-Supervised Learning)
Uses self-supervised learning techniques to train vision transformers on unlabeled data.

Perfect for cases where labeled datasets are limited but pre-training on massive data is possible.

4. DenseNet
Features densely connected layers, where each layer gets inputs from all previous layers.

Efficient in feature extraction, and particularly good for scenarios with limited memory.

5. CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)
Combines image recognition with natural language understanding.

Allows you to match uploaded images with product descriptions or tags alongside visual similarity.

6. YOLO (You Only Look Once) Models
Typically used for object detection but can be adapted for fast feature extraction and matching.

Excellent for real-time applications where speed is crucial.

7. ECA-Net (Efficient Channel Attention Network)
Enhances channel attention mechanisms, improving feature representation without adding much computational overhead.

Ideal for more lightweight but effective models.
